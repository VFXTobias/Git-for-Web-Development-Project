3. What is an attribute and where do we put it? 
	An attribute is a value that helps us configure an HTML element.  It goes after the element targeted.  Eg, an "alt" attribute in an "img" element.

4. What is the h1 tag used for? How many times should I use it on a page?

16. What is the difference between a section and a div
	A section defines a grouping of content that is related whereas a div is just an indicator of a literal box containing content.  The former has semantic meaning for readers and search engines whereas the latter has no meaning other than structural.

19. What is the difference between a class and an id? - Give me an example of when I might use each one
	Class can be a recurring styling element whereas ID is meant to be a single specific selector.  eg, Class h2 styling would style any h2's on a page.  An ID of "Urgent" might apply to a singular item on a page that needs specific attention.  It also supercedes class in importance.
